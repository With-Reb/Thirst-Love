        <p>“This is an absolute gem of a cafe. Wonderful friendly service. The food choice was good, tasty and brilliantly presented, just excellent. My wife was so relaxed, as The owner understood gluten free, which is somewhat rare nowadays. For me the Destructive Ploughman’s was superb and the home made sausage roll was yummy! Oh and the cafe is totally dog friendly! Thank you. Well done. We will be back!!”</p>

        <p>“We always try to support local businesses when visiting places. This didn't disappoint, open at a good time (for us earlier birds), other cages locally not until 9.30/10. My dietary needs were met, good proper mug of tea and coffee tasted good too. Both our meals were tasty and reasonably priced. Friendly staff and owner made it too.”</p>
