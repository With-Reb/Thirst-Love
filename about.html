      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
      Nestled in the heart of Whitstable, Thirst Love Café is a bright, welcoming space where community, creativity, and great coffee come together. Whether you're stopping by for your morning flat white, meeting friends for brunch, or need a cosy corner to work from, we’ve got you covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re passionate about using locally sourced ingredients, serving up fresh bakes and seasonal specials daily. But we’re more than just a café — we’re a hub for connection, calm, and good conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come as you are, stay as long as you like, and sip something lovely while you do.
